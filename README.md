# GebaarNL Android
A Proof Of Concept of the GebaarNL application that was originally developed for iOS. More detailed information about the iOS version can be found @ esmeekluijtmans/gebaarnl-ios.

GebaarNL is an application that teaches people - especially children - the basics of Nederlandse Gebarentaal (Dutch Sign Language). They learn letters and words in sign language while exploring different worlds. 

This POC allows users to practice 3 letters: A, B & C.

**Practice letter**

Users can practice a letter by signing the correct letter to the camera. For each letter, you are required to practice it 2 times to be able to continue to a new letter.
